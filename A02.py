# # Detection of breast cancers
# Train model on CT and PET scans to predict malignant or benign cancer by validating it with histological positive or negative labels
# - Radiologist accuracy: 80% -> Get an accuracy higher than 80%
# ### What to do
# - Anatomical location of the region
# - Characterization of the region
# - Therapeutic choice
# - Monitoring of the therapy to monitor patient's response to treatment
# ### Risk Assessment Analysis -> High Risk tools
# Include Risk Assessment Analysis of the tool in pitch deck
# - Include list of requirements of our system: operating system, tools, forms, etc, cybersecurity risks (login)
# - Tool performances in terms of
#     - Sensitivity (TP rate) -> **at least 90%**
#     - FP rate
#     - Time
# ### Model testing during presentation
# **1 second as maximum response time for testing** -> model will be tested live during presentation
# ### Data privacy
# - Require auth
# - No personal info (name, surname, TAX ID code, address, etc)
# - Cluster ages to reduce privacy risk (each 5 years?)
# ### Requirements
# - DLL library to call functions from -> **segregation of functions**
# - Must have **EXIT** button
# - Cybersecurity of the tool
# - AUC greather than 0.85
# - Sensitivity higher than 0.90
# 
# ### Ethics -> **INCLUDE IT**
# Simulate that we actually got these documents in the first few slides
# - Informed consent (got from the patient)
# - Ethic Committee Approval (about 2 months after study request)
#     - It was approved
# - Anonimization
#     - Define the measures in the data
# 
# ### Methods to be used:
# - Radiomics library
# - Random Forest or SVM (choose one, maybe PCA to choose the best features)
# - CNNs
# 
# ### Dataset (with masks)
# - 437 benign
# - 210 malignant
